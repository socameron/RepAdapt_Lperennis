# RepAdapt - SNP calling pipeline for _Lupinus perennis_

This is a Snakemake pipeline for calling SNPs using bcftools and ANGSD. This pipeline was adapted from the RepAdapt Working Group 'snp calling simple' script. 

Please note: This workflow differs substantially from my on-going workflow with _Lupinus perennis_, where I do not realign indels and also do not filter out paralogy using **ngsParalog**.
